# dunst-volume-brightness
A fork of https://github.com/dastorm/volume-notification-dunst
Requires the faba icon theme and needs to be placed in the same directory as https://github.com/vlevit/notify-send.sh/blob/master/notify-send.sh

The main diff between dastorm's script and mine is that I use paxmixer instead of amixer.  In addition, I've created a lil script to display the brightness by using xbacklight (might have trouble on wayland).
